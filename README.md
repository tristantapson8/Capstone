# Capstone Project
Project for taking floor plan images and converting them to a vectorized image with  room names and locations identified by OCR. Once the image is vectorized, a JSON text file is generated to be used with a front end map editing tool created in open qt. This is 1/2 of the back-end, dealing with image processing in Java.
